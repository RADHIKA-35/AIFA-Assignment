# AIFA-Assignment
Polygon Triangulation is done in two ways:

* Ear Clipping Method
* Fast Siedal's Algorithm

## Built With
Visualisation is built using graphics libarary of C++.

## Usage
In order to run the code type the following :

```
g++ pta_18MA20005_prog1.cpp -lgraph

```

Next on running the output, first enter the number of sides of the Polygon , then enter the coordinates one by one. 
For ex :
```
Enter the coordinates of the polygon one by one and by adjacent sides: 
0 0
3 2
3 10
0 5

```
